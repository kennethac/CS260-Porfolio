        <h2><u>About</u></h2>
        <p>I am a Junior studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University, minoring in Business and (if the stars align) Italian.</p>
        <p>I enjoy learning of all kinds though, and independent learning is one of my passions. I particularly enjoy learning technology, languages and musical instruments.</p>
        <p>I am from Manti, Utah and also love exploring the mountains there and elsewhere as I travel with my gorgeous wife.</p>
